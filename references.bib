  abstract  = "Abstract The Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) software is ubiquitous
               in the Earth and ocean sciences. As a cross-platform tool
               producing high-quality maps and figures, it is used by tens of
               thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of
               GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the
               fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning
               curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users
               alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface,
               which would break compatibility with thousands of existing
               scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum
               by introducing a new ?modern mode? to complement the interface
               used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls ?classic mode.?
               GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade
               for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take
               advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access
               commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the
               new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.",

              volume >1.8$\times$106 km3, and suggest a plate tectonic model
              comprising: (1) development of the Seychelles microplate by
              fan-shaped spreading in the Mascarene Basin, and continental
              extension followed by fan-shaped spreading between India and the
              Seychelles during A29-27 time. (2) Cessation of fan-shaped

              India-Seychelles plate boundary. (3) Margin subsidence, modified

              the east and west boundaries of the Seychelles microplate during
              breakup and early sea floor spreading. In some aspects, the

              regional wedges of seaward dipping reflectors along the

              both continental and oceanic crust. It was probably created

              a small, elongated rifted basin that has been the site of recent
              submarine volcanism. This area lies within the Cyclades back-arc
              region of the present Hellenic subduction zone where the seafloor
              of the eastern Mediterranean Sea is descending beneath the Aegean
              microplate. The Cycladic region and the Aegean Sea as a whole are
              known to be regions of north--south back-arc extension and
              thinning of continental crust. Nineteen submarine volcanic cones
              occur within this small rift zone, the largest of these being
              Kolumbo which last erupted explosively in 1650AD, causing
              significant damage and fatalities on the nearby island of
              Santorini. Previous SEABEAM mapping and seismic studies from HCMR
              indicate that many of the smaller v'olcanic cones have been built
              above the present seafloor, while others are partly buried,
              indicating a range of ages for the activity along this volcanic
              line. None of the cones to the northeast of Kolumbo had been
              explored in detail prior to a cruise of the E/V Nautilus (NA007)
              in August 2010. The ROV Hercules was used to explore the slopes,
              summits and craters of 17 of the 19 centers identified on
              multibeam maps of the area. Water depths of the submarine
              volcano's summits ranged from 18 to 450m. In general, the
              domes/craters northeast of Kolumbo were sediment covered and
              showed little evidence of recent volcanic activity. Outcrops of
              volcanic rock were found in the crater walls and slopes of some
              of the cones but they typically consisted of volcanic fragments
              of pumice and lava that have been cemented together by biological
              activity, indicative of the lack of recent eruptions. Geochemical
              analysis of samples collected on the northeast cones showed
              evidence of low temperature hydrothermal circulation on the
              summit and upper flanks in the form of stream-like manganese
              precipitates emanating from pits and fractures.",

  abstract = "Calderas are important features in all volcanic environments and
              are commonly the sites of geothermal activity and mineralisation.
              Yet, it is only in the last 25 years that a thorough
              three-dimensional study of calderas has been carried out,
              utilising studies of eroded calderas, geophysical analysis of
              their structures and analogue modelling of caldera formation. As
              more data has become available on calderas, their individuality
              has become apparent. A distinction between `caldera', `caldera
              complex', `cauldron', and `ring structure' is necessary, and new
              definitions are given in this paper. Descriptions of calderas,
              based on dominant composition of eruptives (basaltic,
              peralkaline, andesitic--dacitic, rhyolitic) can be used, and
              characteristics of each broad group are given. Styles of eruption
              may be effusive or explosive, with the former dominant in
              basaltic calderas, and the latter dominant in andesitic--dacitic,
              rhyolitic and peralkaline calderas. Four `end-member' collapse
              styles occur---plate or piston, piecemeal, trapdoor, and
              downsag---but many calderas have multiple styles. Features of
              so-called `funnel' and `chaotic' calderas proposed in the
              literature can be explained by other collapse styles and the
              terms are considered unnecessary. Ground deformation comprises
              subsidence or collapse (essential characteristics of a caldera)
              and uplifting/doming and fracturing due to tumescence and/or
              resurgence (frequent, but not essential). Collapse may occur on
              pre-existing structures, such as regional faults or on faults
              created during the caldera formation, and the shape of the
              collapse area will be influenced by depth, size and shape of the
              magma chamber. The final morphology of a caldera will depend on
              how the caldera floor breaks up; whether collapse takes place in
              one event or multiple events, whether vertical movement is
              spasmodic or continuous throughout the eruptive sequence, and
              whether blocks subside uniformly or chaotically at one or more
              collapse centres. A meaningful description of any caldera should
              therefore include; number of collapse events, presence or absence
              of resurgence, caldera-floor coherency, caldera-floor collapse
              geometry, and dominant composition of eruptives.",

              a detailed geophysical mapping over the entire extent of this

              detailed investigation on the Sagar Kanya Seamount and its
              adjacent regions using newly acquired high-resolution multibeam
              bathymetry data, complemented with sea surface magnetic and
              gravity data. Bathymetric map reveals the presence of
              well-defined bathymetric high features constituting three
              seamounts connected with structural high/ridge-like features,
              together representing a large nearly elliptical bathymetric high
              complex surrounding a region of nearly flat seafloor, referred to
              as the Sagar Kanya Bathymetric High Complex (SKBHC). The overall
              morphology of this feature closely resembles with the shape of a
              submarine volcanic caldera. The gravity anomalies over this
              feature are mostly correlatable with topography;
              elliptical-shaped gravity highs are associated with bathymetric
              highs and gravity lows are associated with the enclosed flat
              seafloor. Some magnetic anomalies observed over the SKBHC are
              correlatable with the topographic highs, while others are
              observed over the flat seafloor. The magnetic anomalies are
              interpreted as features of post-caldera volcanism. In view of the
              proximity of this feature to the R{\'e}union hotspot track, and
              the tectonic framework of the region, the genesis of the SKBHC is
              attributed to the R{\'e}union hotspot volcanism.",

  abstract    = "The Indian Ocean and the bordering continental margins are
                 characterized by a number of tectonic features consisting of
                 deep ocean basins, aseismic ridges/ submarine plateaus and
                 seamounts. Marine geophysical studies carried out over these
                 regions for the past four decades have led to an increased
                 understanding of the formation and evolution of these
                 features. The present paper synthesizes an up-to-date
                 compilation of the results of the salient inferences of those
                 studies to describe the structure and tectonic evolution of
                 these features as well as the Indian Ocean in general. A
                 review of the existing knowledge on the structure and
                 tectonics of the continental margins of India and the adjacent
                 ocean basins reveal the existence of several unresolved
                 problems, primarily due to the inherent tectonic complexities
                 or the paucity of adequate data. Some of the major problems
                 that need to be addressed/examined are: the existence and
                 extent of the Prathap and Kori-Comorin ridges; the locations
                 of the continent-ocean boundaries around the continental
                 margins of India; the timing of formation of the deep offshore
                 regions adjacent to the Indian continental margins; the deeper
                 crustal structure and trend of the 85°E Ridge; the crustal
                 configuration as well as the extent of the postulated
                 micro-continental slivers; and the cause of intense seismicity
                 over the Chagos Bank segment of the Laccadive-Chagos Ridge. In
                 addition to addressing these questions, the present paper
                 suggests ways to go forward by acquiring high-resolution and
                 deep penetration multichannel seismic reflection data, seismic
                 refraction data using Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) and
                 closely spaced sea-surface and deep-tow magnetic profiles
                 along with high-resolution seafloor mapping.",

                 data in conjunction with regional satellite derived gravity
                 data and selected subsidence analyses.The area shows many
                 classic characteristics of a volcanic-type margin. Volcanic
                 facies identified and mapped along the margin include
                 seaward-dipping reflectors (SDRs), sub-aerial seamounts,
                 clinoform packages interpreted as lava and volcaniclastic
                 delta systems and thick, seismically layered sequences
                 interpreted as volcanically derived sediment deposited in both
                 fluvial and marine environments. The results show major
                 variation in the overall thickness and style of volcanism
                 across the margin both in dip and strike directions which may
                 be related to variability in influence of the Deccan Plume in
                 addition to localization along structural features inherited
                 from older tectonic events. Our interpretation of rapid
                 lateral variation in the thickness of extrusive volcanism has
                 important implications for the distribution, preservation and
                 hydrocarbon potential of the pre-rift sequence across the
                 margin. The interpreted crustal structure also has a major
                 impact on predictions of the historical and present-day
                 heat-flow into the post-rift section.Our interpretation of the
                 timing and distribution of volcanism is consistent with the
                 presence of a broad region of elevated mantle potential
                 temperatures at the time of the final break-up event on the
                 West Indian Continental Margin, commonly attributed to the
                 Deccan/R{\'e}union Plume. Pre-existing structural
                 heterogeneities appear to have played an important part in
                 controlling the distribution of volcanism. Interpreted
                 tectonic subsidence, based on backstripping analysis of the
                 post-break-up interval, is also shown to be consistent with
                 post-break-up thermal subsidence in combination with dynamic
                 support associated with the elevated mantle temperatures into
                 the Early Eocene.",

                 widely thought to dominate the torques driving plate
                 tectonics. In late Cretaceous and early Paleogene times, the
                 Indian plate moved more rapidly over the mantle than freely
                 subducting slabs sink within it. This signal event has been
                 attributed to arrival of the Deccan--R{\'e}union mantle plume
                 beneath the plate, but it is unknown in which proportions the
                 plume acted to alter the balance of existing plate driving
                 torques and to introduce torques of its own. Our plate
                 kinematic analysis of the Mascarene Basin yields a detailed
                 Indian plate motion history for the period 89--60 Ma. Plate
                 speed initially increases steadily until a pronounced
                 acceleration in the period 68--64 Ma, after which it abruptly
                 returns to values much like those beforehand. This pattern is
                 unlike that suggested to result from the direct introduction
                 of driving forces by the arrival of a thermal plume at the
                 base of the plate. A simple analysis of the gravitational
                 force related to the Indian plate's thickening away from its
                 boundary with the African plate suggests instead that the
                 sudden acceleration and deceleration may be related to uplift
                 of part of that boundary during a period when it was located
                 over the plume head. In this instance, torques related to
                 plate accretion and subduction may have contributed in similar
                 proportions to drive plate motion.",

                 deep ocean basins adjoining the western continental margin of
                 India have evolved largely due to break-up and dispersal of
                 India, Seychelles and Madagascar continental blocks since Late
                 Cretaceous. Mainly owing to the availability of large number
                 of well identified magnetic anomaly picks, the evolution of
                 the region from chron C28ny (~62.5 Ma) and younger times is
                 better constrained than the preceding period of its early
                 evolution. Using constraints of several recently mapped
                 regional scale tectonic features, a plausible model for that
                 early evolution is proposed in this paper. Around 88.0 Ma the
                 involved continental blocks were in their immediate pre-drift
                 configuration where a wide continental rift zone existed
                 between India and Madagascar. Seafloor spreading in the
                 Mascarene Basin commenced shortly before 83.0 Ma. A ternary
                 rift system off Saurashtra peninsula of western India, formed
                 shortly before 68.5 Ma, reached seafloor spreading stage in
                 the Laxmi and Gop basins around 67.6 and 64.7 Ma respectively.
                 Around 62.5 Ma the ancestor of the Carlsberg Ridge spreading
                 center developed between the Seychelles Plateau and the Laxmi
                 Ridge while spreading in the northern Mascarene Basin ceased

                 asymmetric sea floor spreading or plume--ridge interactions.
                 India separated from Seychelles at ∼64 Ma by asymmetric sea
                 floor spreading initially when the spreading centre in the
                 Mascarene Basin jumped towards the Indian sub-continent
                 between magnetic chrons C29 and C28. The subsequent tectonics
                 is difficult to comprehend since Laxmi Ridge-another
                 microcontinent-formed during the later phase. Most of the
                 studies considered the Laxmi Ridge as a sliver. Others
                 considered it to be oceanic crust. High resolution, deep (~25
                 km) seismic data reveals that (i) the ridge possesses > 15 km
                 deep sea-ward dipping reflector (SDR) packages; (ii) normal
                 faulted rift valleys devoid of syn-rift sedimentary packages;
                 and (iii) axial magma chambers 5--7 km beneath the ridge top.
                 Additionally, from 2D forward gravity models we deduce that
                 the ridge most possibly comprises of high density (oceanic)
                 crust. We conclude the Laxmi Ridge to be indeed composed of
                 oceanic crust and a fossil spreading centre. We thus
                 identified the ridge jumps and their relation to the
                 Seychelles microcontinent separation. Previous numerical
                 models suggest that the time required for a ridge jump is
                 controlled by magmatic heating, spreading rate at the ridge,
                 and plate ages. For repeated ridge jumps, the additional
                 factor is the dynamic relation between the plume and
                 lithosphere in terms of melt transfer and heating. We find
                 that the medium spreading rates and high magmatic heating due
                 to the R{\'e}union plume and young plates favoured rapid and
                 repeated ridge jumps towards the plume.",

                 Chagos--Laccadive Ridge (CLR) complex lying along the
                 southwest coast of India has been attributed to different
                 evolutionary processes. Late Cretaceous seafloor spreading
                 between India and Africa formed the Mascarene Basin, and the
                 plate reconstruction models depict unequal crustal accretion
                 in this basin. Re-interpretation of magnetic data in the Gop
                 and Laxmi Basins suggests that the underlying oceanic crust
                 was accreted contemporaneously from 79Ma at slow half
                 spreading rates (0.6 to 1.5cm/yr) separating the
                 Seychelles--Laxmi Ridge complex from India. The spreading
                 ridge became extinct at 71Ma in the central region between
                 19--20°N and 65.5--67°E, and at 68.7Ma in the Gop Basin.
                 Extinction progressed southwards with time until 64.1Ma at
                 ~14.5°N in the Laxmi Basin. This spreading probably limited
                 the seafloor spreading in the northern Mascarene Basin, while
                 normal to fast spreading continued in the south. The fracture
                 zone FZ2 acted as a major boundary between the northern and
                 southern Mascarene Basin, and may have also restricted the
                 southward propagation of the Laxmi Basin spreading ridge.
                 Plate reconstruction models generated in this study
                 accommodate several microplates between Madagascar and India,
                 and trace their movements over time within the India--Africa
                 spreading corridor. Furthermore, these models suggest the
                 formation of the Seychelles--Laxmi Ridge microplate by 79Ma in
                 a complex three plate system. This microplate may have existed
                 up to 64.1Ma and experienced an anticlockwise rotation of
                 about 50°. Under the influence of the Deccan hotspot activity,
                 the Laxmi Basin spreading ridge jumped southwestward splitting
                 the Seychelles--Laxmi Ridge complex and initiating the
                 Carlsberg Ridge. The presence of about 160km of oceanic crust
                 in the Gop and Laxmi Basins partially reduces the space
                 problem faced in the earlier plate reconstruction models.",

                 Mumbai and 60--61 Ma syenitic intrusions in the Seychelles.

                 necessitates a change in plate tectonic reconstruction. Naini

                 this abandoned system. Seismic images document that the
                 crustal necking was associated with the development of
                 seawards-dipping reflector wedges deformed by
                 landwards-dipping detachment faults. A wide crustal necking
                 zone indicates that the ductile lower crust was still present
                 during necking. Observed uneven detachment fault spacing
                 indicates the effect of upper-crustal anisotropy. Comparison
                 of the seismic images through progressively more mature stages
                 of the rift--drift transition documents that the final stages
                 of thinning represented the time period when the upper-crustal
                 wide and symmetrical rift architecture changed to the
                 asymmetrical one, and the decoupled system to the coupled one.
                 It further indicates that the last crustal layer was broken
                 with a convex-up fault that was associated with an excess
                 magmatic event. The fault propagation represented the first
                 spontaneous deformation unaffected by the pre-existing
                 anisotropy. Subsequent drift of the two plates was associated
                 with melt-assisted spreading and spontaneous faulting. The
                 faulting geometry and sequence controlled which of the
                 conjugate margins ended up with a volcanic outer high,
                 representing the record of the break-up-locating excess
                 magmatism.",

  abstract    = "The nature of the crust in the Laxmi Basin, western margin of
                 India, is an uncertain issue; more importantly, this has
                 implications on paleogeographic reconstructions of the western
                 Indian Ocean. We have analyzed three geophysical data sets and
                 modeled gravity and magnetic anomalies for determining nature
                 of the crust. Basement of the Laxmi Basin includes numerous
                 highs, which make the basement uneven and shallower compared
                 to the Western Basin. The Laxmi Basin is characterized by a
                 broad gravity high and a narrower prominent gravity low within
                 it, while within the basin the broad anomaly gradually
                 increases toward north. The Panikkar Ridge is associated with
                 the gravity low, which is comparable, at least in sign, to
                 known negative gravity anomaly of the Laxmi Ridge. Intrusive
                 structures mapped in the Laxmi Basin coincide with significant
                 magnetic anomalies, which were earlier interpreted as
                 seafloor-spreading anomalies. Model studies reveal that the
                 Laxmi Basin consists of ?14 km thick stretched continental
                 crust, in which magmatic bodies have been emplaced, whereas
                 the Panikkar Ridge remains less altered stretched continental
                 crust. The crust of the Laxmi Basin is mostly thinner than
                 crust under the Laxmi Ridge and continental margin. In
                 addition to the rift-drift-related stretching of the
                 continental margin, the Laxmi Basin possibly has undergone
                 extra stretching in E-W direction during the pre-Tertiary
                 period. At ?68 Ma Deccan volcanism on western India may have
                 disrupted the initial conditions that were leading to onset of
                 spreading in the basin. Subsequently the R{\'e}union hot spot
                 had emplaced the volcanic material within the stretched
                 thinned continental crust. We interpret the Laxmi Basin as a
                 failed rift, undergone stretching following intraplate
                 kinematics prior to Deccan volcanism.",
